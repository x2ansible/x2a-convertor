# no-handler

Tasks with `when: result.changed` conditions should use handlers with `notify` instead.

## Problematic code

```yaml
- name: Register result of a task
  ansible.builtin.copy:
    dest: "/tmp/placeholder"
    content: "Ansible made this!"
    mode: 0600
  register: result

- name: Second command to run
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    msg: The placeholder file was modified!
  when: result.changed
```

## Correct code

```yaml
- name: Register result of a task
  ansible.builtin.copy:
    dest: "/tmp/placeholder"
    content: "Ansible made this!"
    mode: 0600
  notify:
    - Second command to run

handlers:
  - name: Second command to run
    ansible.builtin.debug:
      msg: The placeholder file was modified!
```

**Tip:** Handlers run only once at the end of a play, even if notified multiple times.
