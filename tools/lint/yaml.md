# yaml

Checks YAML syntax for indentation and formatting issues.

## Common indentation issues

### Problematic code

```yaml
# Incorrect indentation
- name: Configure service
  service:
  name: nginx  # <- Should be indented under service
  state: started
```

```yaml
# Inconsistent indentation
- name: Install packages
  apt:
    name: nginx
      state: present  # <- Too much indentation
```

```yaml
# Comment indentation
- name: Task
  debug:
    msg: "test"
      # <- Comment indented incorrectly
```

### Correct code

```yaml
# Correct indentation
- name: Configure service
  service:
    name: nginx  # <- Properly indented
    state: started
```

```yaml
# Consistent indentation
- name: Install packages
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present  # <- Aligned with name
```

```yaml
# Comment indentation
- name: Task
  debug:
    msg: "test"
  # <- Comment at correct level
```

## Other common issues

### Octal values

```yaml
# Problematic
permissions: 0777  # <- yaml[octal-values]

# Correct
permissions: "0777"  # <- Quote octal values
```

### Duplicate keys

```yaml
# Problematic
foo: value1
foo: value2  # <- yaml[key-duplicates]

# Correct
foo: value2  # <- Use unique keys
```
