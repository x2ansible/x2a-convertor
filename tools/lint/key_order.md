# key-order

`name` must always be first; `block`, `rescue`, and `always` must be last (after `when`, `tags`, etc.).

## Problematic code

```yaml
- hosts: localhost
  name: This is a playbook # name should be first
  tasks:
    - name: A block
      block:
        - name: Display message
          debug:
            msg: "Hello"
      when: true # when should be before block
```

## Correct code

```yaml
- name: This is a playbook
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: A block
      when: true
      block:
        - name: Display message
          debug:
            msg: "Hello"
```

**Tip:** Putting `block`, `rescue`, and `always` last prevents confusion when tasks grow large - it keeps conditions like `when` close to the task name where they belong.
