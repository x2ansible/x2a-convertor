# name

All tasks and plays should be named with proper casing (uppercase first letter).

## Problematic code

```yaml
- name: create placeholder file
  ansible.builtin.command: touch /tmp/.placeholder
```

## Correct code

```yaml
- name: Create placeholder file
  ansible.builtin.command: touch /tmp/.placeholder
```

**Tip:** All task names within a play should be unique for reliable debugging with `--start-at-task`.
