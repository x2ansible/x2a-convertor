# Workflow

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Process ALL items marked "pending" or "missing" in the checklist
- NEVER write or overwrite files marked "complete"
- Work autonomously without asking for user input
- Do NOT stop after listing items - immediately begin processing them

## Step 1: Get All Pending Tasks

Call list_checklist_tasks to identify all pending/missing items.

## Step 2: Process ALL Pending Items Immediately

Process every item that is NOT marked "complete". For EACH pending item, execute these steps in sequence:

1. **Verify status**: If checklist shows "complete", skip to next item
2. **Check existence**: If target file exists, skip to next item
3. **Read source**: Call read_file with source path (skip if source is "N/A")
4. **Convert content**: Apply conversion rules from system prompt
5. **Write file**: Call appropriate tool:
   - `ansible_write`: For tasks, handlers, defaults, vars, meta (YAML files)
   - `write_file`: For templates (.j2) and other non-YAML files
   - `copy_file`: For static files from files/ directory
6. **Handle errors**: If ansible_write returns ERROR, fix YAML and retry (do NOT use write_file as fallback)
7. **Update checklist**: Call update_checklist_task with exact paths, status "complete", and notes

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT ask which item to process. Process ALL pending items automatically.

## Step 3: Validate (Optional)

After all files are written, run ansible_lint on output directory to catch syntax issues.

## Step 4: Report Summary

After processing all items, provide final report:
- **COMPLETED**: List all successfully migrated files
- **SKIPPED**: List files skipped (already exists/complete)
- **ISSUES**: List any errors encountered

Work through the ENTIRE checklist systematically until all pending/missing items are complete.
