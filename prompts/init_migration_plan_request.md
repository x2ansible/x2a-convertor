Analyze this directory for migration to Ansible.

User requirements: {user_requirements}

The current directory structure (max depth 3, excluding hidden files):
```
{files}
```

Based on this structure, create a comprehensive `{migration_plan_file}` file that follows the template structure.

Focus on:
1. Identifying the current technology (Chef, Puppet, Salt, etc.) from file extensions and structure
2. Cataloging all modules/cookbooks/manifests and their purposes
3. Mapping dependencies (Berksfile, Policyfile, metadata, etc.)
4. Identifying configuration files, secrets, and security considerations
5. Estimating migration complexity and timeline based on module count
6. Providing coordination guidance for teams

Write the complete migration plan to `{migration_plan_file}` in the root directory.
